# Pangeo Notebook Veda Image

Docker container based on pangeo-notebook used on VEDA JupyterHub.

## Testing the image

The notebooks in `image-tests/` folder are used to test the docker image. They are run by `repo2docker` github action during the build process and the output is compared to the existing notebooks. You can read more about how the tests are run in the [repo2docker github action documentation](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action?tab=readme-ov-file#testing-the-built-image).

Note that the test notebooks, by default, do not have access to private resources (eg. private S3 buckets).

### Adding new tests

To add new tests, create new notebooks or add to the existing notebooks in `image-tests/` and generate the output of the notebooks by running the following command:

```bash
docker build -t pangeo-notebook-veda .
docker run -v ./image-tests:/home/jovyan/image-tests pangeo-notebook-veda jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --inplace --execute image-tests/*.ipynb
```

### Running the test notebooks interactively

To interactively run the test notebooks in a JupiterLab environment locally, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t pangeo-notebook-veda .
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v ./image-tests:/home/jovyan/image-tests pangeo-notebook-veda jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0
```

### Using a Pre-built Image

If you don't want to build the image yourself, you can use a pre-built image from ECR. To run the test notebooks in a JupiterLab environment locally using the pre-built image, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v ./image-tests:/home/jovyan/image-tests public.ecr.aws/nasa-veda/pangeo-notebook-veda-image:latest jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0
```

### Running the tests locally

To run the tests locally, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t pangeo-notebook-veda .
docker run pangeo-notebook-veda bash /srv/repo/scripts/run_tests.sh
```
